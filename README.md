Course Management: Enables students to view their enrolled courses, facilitating academic planning and organization with validated data.
Exam Result Viewing: Allows students to check their exam results promptly, promoting transparency and accountability in assessment with validated results.
💡 Key Technologies: C Programming Language

👨‍💻 My Role: Sole developer responsible for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the Student Information System.
